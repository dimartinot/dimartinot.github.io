We propose to use unsupervised deep learning to auto-encode the temporal information in 3 dimensions, allowing to use the three descriptors as three RGB components to produce a colored composition synthesizing the information. We compare this Convolutional AutoEncoder (CAE) approach with a dimensionality reduction based on a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) of the temporal profiles. The two methods, CAE and PCA, are applied to a time series over the Kyagar Glacier before and after a surge event, and on an alpine watershed to compare the differences in dynamic evolution associated with different terrain classes with and without snow. On the one hand, on the glacier, the stacks of 10 images used are too short for CAE to extract more than two really significant axes. On the other hand, with longer profiles available over the alpine watershed, the CAE is interesting to improve the clustering results obtained from the decomposition.","tags":["Deep Learning","Remote Sensing","SAR","Glacier"],"title":"Extracting relevance from SAR temporal profiles on a glacier and an alpine watershed by a deep autoencoder","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Laurane  Charrier","Thomas Di Martino","Elise Colin Koeniguer","Flora Weissgerber","Aurélien Plyer"],"categories":["Deep Learning","Remote Sensing","SAR","Glacier"],"content":"","date":1654549200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1654549200,"objectID":"2f16d5f9eb35044c5c2943551e0747fd","permalink":"https://dimartinot.com/talk/isprs22/","publishdate":"2022-06-06T21:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/isprs22/","section":"talk","summary":"","tags":["Deep Learning","Remote Sensing","SAR","Glacier"],"title":"ISPRS CONGRESS 2022: International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Thomas Di Martino","Elise Colin Koeniguer","Régis Guinvarc'h","Laetitia Thirion-Lefevre"],"categories":["Deep Learning","Remote Sensing","SAR","Forest"],"content":"","date":1653339600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1653339600,"objectID":"fcaaaf9ab49006957764a3b253ac8285","permalink":"https://dimartinot.com/talk/lps22/","publishdate":"2022-05-23T21:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/lps22/","section":"talk","summary":"Presentations of 2 posters at LPS 2022 on various applications of Convolutional Autoencoders to SAR time series:\n- Convolutional Autoencoder for the unsupervised extraction of fire footprints from Sentinel-1 time-series\n- Extraction of variations in agricultural practices over rice fields using unsupervised learning","tags":["Deep Learning","Remote Sensing","SAR","Forest"],"title":"LPS 2022: Living Planet Symposium","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Thomas Di Martino","Régis Guinvarc'h","Laetitia Thirion-Lefevre","Elise Colin Koeniguer"],"categories":["Deep Learning","Remote Sensing","SAR","Temporal SAR","Autoencoder","Agriculture"],"content":"","date":1628262000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1628262000,"objectID":"60e6076c86cc785abe7eaa92601b7e37","permalink":"https://dimartinot.com/publication/journal_cae/","publishdate":"2021-08-06T15:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/journal_cae/","section":"publication","summary":"We present a fully unsupervised learning pipeline, which involves both a projection method and a clustering algorithm dedicated to the pixel-wise classification of multitemporal SAR images. We design a Convolutional Autoencoder as the method to project our time series onto a lower dimensional latent space, where semantically similar temporal signals are placed close together. The additional use of convolutional layers as feature extraction steps allows us to exploit the sequential nature of time series, exhibiting higher representation performance than fully connected layers. The extracted clusters can encapture different semantic levels to either separate classes or extract outlying temporal signals. The application of this method to crop-types mapping enables the extraction of major crop-types within a scene, without supervision. In a labeled context, this method also allows for the extraction of outlying profiles which can lead to the discovery of mislabeled time series.","tags":["Deep Learning","Remote Sensing","SAR","Temporal SAR","Agriculture"],"title":"Beets or Cotton?

They define a feature extraction pipeline that creates a latent representation of input data. This embedding vector is semantically highly descriptive and can be used for the computation of distances between data records to measure similarity. While similarity learning is a popular topic, the combination of multiple modalities has not yet been attracted most of the attention of the field. In the context of Duplicate Product Identification, both the textual description of the product and their pictures can be used to make the similarity decision. This context of using data descriptors, e.g images and text, of different modalities require to rethink the concept of Siamese Network to perform multimodal similarity learning. In this work, multiple approaches have been explored: unimodal \u0026 multimodal Similarity Learning algorithms. The latter, combining embeddings across multiple modalities through gradient sharing method was proven to outperform any other combination of unimodal approaches through the use of N-Way \u0026 F-Beta Scoring. Furthermore, our analysis of the impact on the learnt features of the combination of multiple modalities has given insights on how they can collaborate to optimize the training function by detecting the most informative features for each modality. Comparing the weights of a multimodal siamese network to unimodal network helped to better evaluate cross-modality data profiles captured within the embeddings.","tags":["Deep Learning","NLP","Similarity Learning"],"title":"MSc Thesis: Multimodal Similarity Learning for Duplicate Product Identification","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":["Deep Learning","NLP"],"content":"","date":1593547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593547200,"objectID":"d03aaf28f4f628df14fbeadee37f48ba","permalink":"https://dimartinot.com/post/medium_siamese_loss/","publishdate":"2020-06-30T20:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/medium_siamese_loss/","section":"post","summary":"Deep Similarity Learning is the training of a deep learning architecture to learn to detect similarity and disimilarity between two inputs (or more).

All these results are consultable in my presentation video.\r\rYou can also dive into my code in these multiple notebooks !\nOpen test notebook \r\rOpen FPN training notebook \r\r\r","date":1571529600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571529600,"objectID":"cfaa9ce9494709631f199e0c4a2466ef","permalink":"https://dimartinot.com/project/artificial_moon/","publishdate":"2019-10-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/artificial_moon/","section":"project","summary":"In this project, I trained 4 DL segmentation models on an artificial Lunar Dataset to see how they will perform on real moon images from Nasa.","tags":["Deep Learning","Python","Computer Vision","ipynb","ML","DS"],"title":"Segmentation Models on artificial moon imagery","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Obtained with a grade of 83/100, multiple subject have been treated:\n\r Introduction to Neural Networks (Perceptron, MLP...)\r Theory of the Gradient Descent (Learning Rate Decay...)\r Theory of ConvNets (convolution, pooling...)\r Case study (AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet...)\r Visualization (Manifold Untangling, t-sne...)\r Advanced optimization (Momentum, NAG, AdaDelta, Adam...)\r Unsupervised Learning (GAN, Context Encoder...)\r RCNN and derivates\r\nSee certificate..\r\r","date":1565128800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1565128800,"objectID":"845bcacb48efcd98dfb19a478226c895","permalink":"https://dimartinot.com/moocs/deeplearning.ai-sequence-models-/","publishdate":"2019-08-07T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/moocs/deeplearning.ai-sequence-models-/","section":"moocs","summary":"During this course, I studied Recurrent Neural Networks with multiple historical models (RNNs, GRUs, LSTMs) as well as word encoding (Word Embedding..)","tags":["AI","DL"],"title":"Sequence Models","type":"moocs"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Obtained with a grade of 83/100, multiple subject have been treated:\n\r Introduction to Neural Networks (Perceptron, MLP...)\r Theory of the Gradient Descent (Learning Rate Decay...)\r Theory of ConvNets (convolution, pooling...)\r Case study (AlexNet, VGG, GoogLeNet, ResNet...)\r Visualization (Manifold Untangling, t-sne...)\r Advanced optimization (Momentum, NAG, AdaDelta, Adam...)\r Unsupervised Learning (GAN, Context Encoder...)\r RCNN and derivates\r\nSee certificate..\r\r","date":1562450400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1562450400,"objectID":"6b0b2993a6b0ec697fc73a4ee6ccda25","permalink":"https://dimartinot.com/moocs/deeplearning.ai-improving-deep-neuralnets-/","publishdate":"2019-07-07T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/moocs/deeplearning.ai-improving-deep-neuralnets-/","section":"moocs","summary":"This course taught me the ‘magic’ of getting deep learning to work well.
